# Metaccordion (DEV)
WordPress plugin to merge all post editor sidebar meta-boxes into one fixed sidebar accordion.

**This is an early development build, so use on production sites is at your own risk.** It's a very simple plugin that is unlikely to break anything, but if it does, don't say I didn't warn you. (And please file an issue. Thanks.)

Adds CSS/JS to convert the never ending list of meta-boxes into a fixed position accordion sidebar, with Publish always expanded. This keeps Publish where we’re all used to it being, but also ensures it’s almost always visible (the sidebar can be scrolled if there’s too many items to fit, but because the boxes are collapsed, Publish is never far away).

It’s a simple change, but it makes all the sidebar meta-boxes visible at a glance at all times. That makes editing post types with a significant number of meta-boxes much, much easier.
